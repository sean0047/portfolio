            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As a motivated Software Engineer, I bring a <b>Bachelor of Computer Science in Software Engineering</b> and several years of hands-on experience to the table. My journey in tech has equipped me with a robust skill set, including proficiency in React, React Native, MongoDB, and JavaScript, enabling me to design and maintain high-quality, scalable web and mobile applications.</p>
            <p>I'm a firm believer in continuous improvement, constantly researching emerging technologies and enhancing my skills through certifications. I value a collaborative team environment where I can contribute to impactful solutions and mentor junior developers. With a strong work ethic and a logical approach to problem-solving, I'm excited to embrace new challenges. On a personal note, I'm married and eagerly anticipating the joys of fatherhood.</p>

            <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
            <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>
            <p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this document and wanting to gain a deeper understanding of my intentions as a future employee.</p> 
            <p>I would describe myself as rarely unprepared, committed, but also as a continuous learner. I truly believe the process of always learning is an uncommon skill these days.</p> 
            <p>I am also very detail-oriented and put forth a strong effort into everything I accomplish. Leaving tasks incomplete/unfinished gives me a sour taste to how I view my work ethic.</p> 
            <p>I know I would be a strong asset to any company through my commitment and think outside-the-box energy. My professional and educational experiences with group-based projects have helped me understand different software used throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>

            <p>Live Chat Application with Businesses/Customers:
