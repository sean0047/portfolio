            <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

            <p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this document and wanting to gain a deeper understanding of my intentions as a future employee. I would describe myself as rarely unprepared, committed, but also as a continuous learner. I truly believe the process of always learning is an uncommon skill these days. I am also very detail-oriented and put forth a strong effort into everything I accomplish. Leaving tasks incomplete/unfinished gives me a sour taste to how I view my work ethic. I know I would be a strong asset to any company through my commitment and think outside-the-box energy. My professional and educational experiences with group-based projects have helped me understand different software used throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>
